Description:

This Python application automates the process of transferring information from an Excel spreadsheet to a certificate image. Instead of manually copying and pasting data from the spreadsheet to the certificate, this program reads the data from the spreadsheet and "writes" it onto the certificate image automatically.

Features:

Reads data from an Excel spreadsheet containing information such as course name, participant name, type of participation, duration, start date, end date, and issuance date.
Copies this information onto a certificate image, eliminating the need for manual entry.
Streamlines the process and reduces human error.
Currently, configuration settings are managed within the code.
Future plans include developing a user-friendly interface where users can select the spreadsheet and certificate image.
The ultimate goal is to compile the application into an executable (exe) file for intuitive use.

How to Use:

Run the program.
Select the spreadsheet and folder where you will save the certificates.
Click on "Gerar Certificados"
Wait until the operation ends.
The program automatically fetches data from the designated Excel spreadsheet.
It then transfers this data onto the certificate image.
The resulting certificate images are saved automatically.
This application simplifies the administrative tasks associated with issuing certificates for courses or events, making the process more efficient and less prone to errors.
